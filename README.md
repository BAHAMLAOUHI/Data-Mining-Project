# Online Fraud Detection Using Clustering and Anomaly Detection

Dataset: A publicly available dataset from Kaggle, specifically designed for fraud detection.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Preprocessing: Initial data exploration and cleaning to understand key patterns and prepare the data for modeling.
Dimensionality Reduction: Application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Agglomerative Clustering Hierarchy (ACH) to reduce the dimensionality and complexity of the dataset while retaining important features.
Clustering: Leveraging unsupervised learning techniques to identify clusters of potential fraudulent activity.
Anomaly Detection: Identification of unusual patterns or transactions that could indicate fraudulent activity, using advanced anomaly detection algorithms.

This project demonstrates how data mining techniques, including clustering and anomaly detection, can be leveraged to effectively identify fraudulent activity in online transactions, highlighting the importance of robust preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised learning methods.
